# Physically-Based Ray Tracer
**This is a learning project.** The main objective of this repository is to implement a small C# version of the physically-based ray tracer described in [Physically Based Rendering â€“ From Theory to Implementation](https://www.pbr-book.org/). This book "describes both the mathematical theory behind a modern photorealistic rendering system as well as its practical implementation".


Obviously, this repository does not aim to match the quality or feature set available in the [official pbrt implementation](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).
